# FXTools
FXTools are bunch of simple tools to make Firefox sandboxing as easy and secure as possible.
It helps user creating an Firefox profile and then after each usage of browser, 
it checks if any file (executable, and all profile files) aren't compromised (changed) since last usage.
Scripts are still under development, and it's not recommended to use it on your main work machine!
